# Test Projects

Test Projects is a repository containing small, interesting projects that I have been working on to explore various technologies.

In the event I want to pursue this project further, I will extract it out of this repo and into a seperate repo for that project.

## Project List

1. **Back-end REST API with Spotify OAuth**
   Description: This project involves creating a back-end REST API using Node.js to connect to Spotify's API and configure OAuth authentication. It enables users to interact with Spotify's services programmatically, such as accessing user data, managing playlists, and playing music.
   
2. **Automatic Bot with JavaScript**
   Description: This project focuses on building an automatic bot that replies to messages based on command triggers using JavaScript. The bot is designed to monitor chat channels or platforms and respond to specific commands or keywords with predefined actions or messages.
   
3. **Python Scripts**
   Description: This section contains various Python scripts developed for different purposes, such as data manipulation, automation tasks, web scraping, and more. These scripts demonstrate my proficiency in Python programming and showcase practical applications of the language.
